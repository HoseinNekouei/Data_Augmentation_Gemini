# Gemini Data Augmentation Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to perform data augmentation using Google's Gemini model to address imbalanced datasets. By leveraging Gemini's powerful generative capabilities, we can effectively augment datasets to improve model performance, particularly in tasks like sentiment analysis, where class imbalances are common.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- `google.generativeai` library
- Access to Google's Gemini API (API key required)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/HoseinNekouei/Data_Augmentation_Gemini.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Obtain your API key for Google's Gemini and configure it:

```python
import google.generativeai as genai
from google.colab import userdata

# Add Google API key in secret manager
GOOGLE_API_KEY = userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY_ATENA')

# Configure the genai library with the API key
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

### Notebook Contents

- **Gemini_Data_Augmentation_v_2.ipynb**: This notebook contains detailed steps and code snippets for performing data augmentation using the Gemini model. It covers dataset loading, model initialization, generation configuration, and example usage.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example code snippet from the notebook
from generate_text import generate_text

# Initialize model and generation configuration
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.0-pro')
generation_config = genai.types.GenerationConfig(
    candidate_count=1,
    max_output_tokens=36,
    top_k=1,
    temperature=1.0
)

# Define prompt
prompt = "Once upon a time in a faraway land,"

# Generate text
response = generate_text(model, prompt, generation_config)
print(response)
```
